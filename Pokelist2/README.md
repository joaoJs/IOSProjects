# Pokelist

Little project that uses the pokemon api. The name is Lorem Picsum becase I duplicated the project lorem picsum to help at the start. 

The project uses codable to decode the json that comes as a response from the request. 

There are some bugs still. Sometimes the images are not fetched correctly. 

I also still need to make the pictures load on demand (lazyload) and add the list of moves and abilities to the detail view.

I need a bit of extra time to do that. I spent a lot of time working trying to cache the data and changing the color of the types. 

Setting up the detail view layout was not easy either.

# Objective-C Swift Project

The project is called Music Albums but it uses the pokemon api to display a list of Pokemon in a Table View.
The main goal of the project is to use Objective-C and Swift in a project. The most difficult part was to make the prefetch work. It is not working at the moment, I need to get back to it.

Adding tests was fun, and the project has 82,5 % total coverage. The View Model Class has 90,3% total coverage. 
I am mocking the network service and injecting it to the VM to do the tests
